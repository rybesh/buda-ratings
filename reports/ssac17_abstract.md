### Abstract for 2017 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference

Nearly 5 million people in the United States participate in the sport of ultimate frisbee. Of these, about 1.5 million are core participants, meaning that they play ultimate at least 12 times annually. This is more than lacrosse (0.82 million) and rugby (0.36 million) combined. The vast majority of core participants play in recreational leagues in which teams are formed by randomly assigning players to teams such that league-wide parity is maximized.

An integral component of ensuring parity across the entire league is an unbiased player rating system.
