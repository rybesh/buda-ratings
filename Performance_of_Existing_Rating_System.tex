\section{Performance of Existing BUDA Rating System}\label{sec:existing_performance}

To investigate the performance of the existing player rating system used by BUDA, we use average per-game score differential, which we call ``Average Plus/Minus per Game''. There are many justifiable ways to rate team performance \cite{Langville_2012}.  We chose average score differential for two reasons.  One is that BUDA recreational league have seven games per season, so using won-loss record leaves the sample size very small.  There are typically 15-20 goals scored per game, so using score differential increases the sample size significantly.  The second reason is more philosophical in nature.  For the purposes of a recreational league, it is our belief that a team that loses every game by only one goal has a better experience than a team that wins one game out of seven but loses on average by four goals.
