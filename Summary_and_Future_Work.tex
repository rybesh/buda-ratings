\section{Future Work}\label{sec:summary}

We have established that individual self-assessment ratings should be used as a last resort. We have also shown that a player's club rating (based on their experience in club leagues) is more predictive of their true skill level than a player's captain rating (which itself is much better than a self-assessment rating). We expect that the guidelines provided in Section~\ref{sec:recommendations} will yield teams with much more balance than is currently typical in BUDA recreational leagues. Yet, there remains the potential to improve player ratings even further given the data at hand. Here are the most significant potential paths of research from our perspective.

\begin{itemize}

\item BUDA tracks individual game scores for all league games. This is important because in a typical BUDA recreational league, the season is 7 games long. A given team will play only 64\% of the possible competition. Under these conditions, it should be possible to use individual game scores to produce more accurate measures of team performance \cite{Langville_2012}. On the other hand, variation in individual game scores is likely to be influenced significantly by random factors such as attendance and luck. An important topic for future research is to determine the utility of individual game scores.

\item Individual game scores can also be used to measure team performance in club leagues. This could improve the predictive ability of club ratings for players in recreational leagues. The same benefits and caveats to using individual game scores apply here as well.

\item It is possible to use recreational league playing history to develop a ``Recreational'' rating that uses the same methodology as club rating, but as applied to recreational league experience. The challenge with this approach is that these teams are designed to be comparable in skill level, so the signal-to-noise is lower. The best approach may be to consider which seasons a player has played in, since some seasons are indicative of stronger skill (winter indoor leagues) whereas others indicate weaker skill (summer or fall leagues).

\item Strategy in ultimate frisbee dictates that the best players on a given roster will touch the disc the most and be the most involved in play.  It may therefore be sensible to weight the skill level of the top portion of a given roster more than bottom portion when determining a team rating from a collection of individual ratings. This could lead to stronger correlation between team rating and team performance. However, it is likely to have the same impact regardless of rating approach, so we leave this for future work.

\item We have shown that club ratings and captain ratings are more predictive than self-assessment ratings. However, it may be the case that differences between club ratings or captain ratings and self-assessment ratings hold predictive power as well. For example, if someone rates themselves as a 75 (a very strong player), but their club rating is 50 (an average player), this could indicate someone who has an inflated opinion of their skills. This is likely to translate on the field to turnovers resulting from poor decision-making.  Including rating differentials as an additional component of player assessment may improve predictive power.

\item Machine learning competitions have shown very clearly that an ensemble of distinct model predictions (ratings in this application) outperform than individual model predictions. Ensemble rating: weighted average of captain rating and club rating.

\item How to run the draft (and deal with baggage).
