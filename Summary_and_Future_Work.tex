\section{Future Work}\label{sec:summary}

We have established that individual self-assessment ratings should be used as a last resort. We have also shown that a player's club rating (based on their experience in club leagues) is more predictive of their true skill level than a player's captain rating (which itself is much better than a self-assessment rating). We expect that the guidelines provided in Section~\ref{sec:recommendations} will yield teams with much more balance than is currently typical in BUDA recreational leagues. Yet, there remains the potential to improve player ratings even further given the data at hand. Here are the most significant potential paths of research from our perspective.

\begin{itemize}

\item Alternative measurements of team performance: use individual game scores.

\item Use recreational league playing history.

\item Weight top quarter of roster more than bottom three-quarters.

\item Ensemble rating: weighted average of captain rating and club rating.

\item Test if overrating oneself relative to club rating or captain rating indicates further penalties on club rating or captain rating are needed.

\item How to run the draft (and deal with baggage).

\end{itemize}
