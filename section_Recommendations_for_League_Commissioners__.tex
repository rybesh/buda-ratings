\section{Recommendations for League Commissioners}

Discuss significance of five points of club rating on a 16 player team.  Corresponds to 80 points total, or roughly replacing worst player on roster with one of best players in the league.

Recommend that league organizers use club data if available.  Organizers should strongly encourage captains to rate players (perhaps provide a monetary reward).
