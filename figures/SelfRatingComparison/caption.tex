Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between Average Plus/Minus per Game score and individual self-assessment rating. The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient is printed in the lower left corner of the panel. Self-assessment ratings show a negative correlation with actual in-game performance $(r = -0.13)$, although the p-value of 0.08 indicates as much as an 8\% chance that this correlation could be a result of random noise. The absence of a strong, positive correlation in this plot indicates that self-assessment ratings are not a useful predictor of team performance. \label{fig:correlation_self}
