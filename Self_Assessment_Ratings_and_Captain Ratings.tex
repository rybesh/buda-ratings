\section{Self-Assessment Ratings and Captain Ratings}\label{sec:self_rating}

One of the key components of the BUDA player rating system is self-assessment ratings from the players themselves.  These are generated from survey answers that players provide when signing up for a recreational league with BUDA. Survey questions address each player's ability to throw, catch, and run.  There is also a question related to each player's experience level, but it is given little weight in the final self-assessment rating. The majority of the weight is given to questions on the topic of throwing. Self-assessment ratings are scaled to range from 10 (lowest) to 100 (highest).
