Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between average per game plus/minus score and Self Rating (left panel), Captain Rating (middle panel), and Existing BUDA Rating (right panel).  The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient is printed in each panel. Ratings based on individual self-assessment (Self Rating) show a negative correlation with actual in-game performance, although the p-value of 0.08 indicates as much as an 8\% chance that this correlation could be a result of random noise. The absence of a strong, positive correlation in this plot indicates that Self Rating is not a useful predictor of team performance. On the other hand, Captain Rating is positively correlated with per-game plus/minus. This shows that ratings from captains are more accurate than ratings based on self-assessment. Finally, the existing BUDA rating system is a simple average of the Self Rating and the Captain Rating.  There is evidence for mildly positive correlation, but the p-value indicates about a one in five chance that the observed correlation results from random noise.  This shows that including individual self-assessment on equal footing with captain ratings considerably reduces the predictive power of the ratings. It provides a clear explanation for why the existing BUDA rating system regularly results in imbalanced teams.
