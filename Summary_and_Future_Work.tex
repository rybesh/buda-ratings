\begin{itemize}

\item Alternative measurements of team performance: use individual game scores.

\item Use recreational league playing history.

\item Weight top quarter of roster more than bottom three-quarters.

\item Ensemble rating: weighted average of captain rating and club rating.

\item Test if overrating oneself relative to club rating or captain rating indicates further penalties on club rating or captain rating are needed.

\item How to run the draft (and deal with baggage).
