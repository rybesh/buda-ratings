Left: Distribution of average Plus/Minus per game over 171 teams in seven years of BUDA spring season recreational ultimate frisbee leagues.  Blue curve shows the observed distribution while grey curve shows the expected distribution for teams of equal skill level. The observed distribution is much broader than expected, indicating significant imbalance in team skill level. Right: Percent chance of Team A beating team B as a function of time remaining in the game if the teams are of equal skill level (blue line) and if Team A loses its games to Team B by an average of 5 goals per game (green). In the unbalanced scenario, the weaker team begins with a 8.5\% chance of winning and on average starts halftime with a 3.4\% chance of winning. This demonstrates that a team that loses by 5 goals per game is significantly inferior to the average team in a given league. \label{fig:buda_performance}
