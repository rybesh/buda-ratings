Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between average per game plus/minus score and individual self-assessment Rating.  The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient is printed in the lower left corner of the panel. Self-assessment ratings show a negative correlation with actual in-game performance, although the p-value of 0.08 indicates as much as an 8\% chance that this correlation could be a result of random noise. The absence of a strong, positive correlation in this plot indicates that self-assessment ratings are not a useful predictor of team performance.
