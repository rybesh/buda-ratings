Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between average per game plus/minus score and Club Rating. The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient of $r = 0.43$ is significantly higher than the correlation coefficient based on Captain Rating ($r = 0.31$) and much higher than that based on Self Rating ($r = -0.13$). This shows that Club Rating is the best predictor of team performance and should be used whenever possible to assign ratings.
