Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between points per game differential and club-assessment rating. The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient of $r = 0.43$ is significantly higher than the correlation coefficient based on captain-assessment ratings $(r = 0.31)$ and much higher than that based on self-assessment ratings $(r = -0.13)$. This shows that club-assessment rating is the best predictor of team performance and should be used whenever possible to assign ratings. \label{fig:correlation_club}
