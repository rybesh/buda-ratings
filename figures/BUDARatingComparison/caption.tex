Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between average per game plus/minus score and rating according to existing BUDA system, which is an average of self-assessment rating and captain rating (see text for details). The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient is printed in the lower left corner of the panel. There is evidence for mildly positive correlation, but the p-value indicates about a one in five chance that the observed correlation results from random noise.  This shows that including individual self-assessment on equal footing with captain ratings considerably reduces the predictive power of the ratings. It provides a clear explanation for why the existing BUDA rating system regularly results in imbalanced teams. \label{fig:correlation_buda}
