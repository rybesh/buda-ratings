Nearly 1.5 million people in the United States are core participants in the sport of ultimate frisbee, meaning that they play at least 12 times annually. The vast majority of core participants play in recreational leagues in which teams are formed by randomly assigning players according to skill level such that league-wide parity is maximized. Historically, skill level has been determined by each individualâ€™s self-assessment. Such ratings tend to be biased in ways that create significantly imbalanced teams. In this contribution, we use seven years of recreational ultimate frisbee league data from the Boston Ultimate Disc Alliance to show that a rating system based on self-assessment regularly results in 8\% of teams in a given league winning less than 15\% of their games---approximately double the rate expected if teams were equal in skill level. We introduce an alternative method of evaluating skill level that relies on information regarding which club team a given player has played on in the past. This ``club'' rating is a better indicator of future performance than self-ratings. We provide guidelines for league commissioners to use when incorporating this new data-driven approach in their own player rating systems.
