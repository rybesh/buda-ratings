Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between average per game plus/minus score and captain rating.  The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient is printed in the lower left corner of the panel. Unlike, self-assessment ratings, captain ratings are positively correlated with per-game plus/minus $(r = 0.31)$. This shows that ratings from captains are more accurate than ratings based on self-assessment.
