Correlation observed in seven years of BUDA recreational ultimate frisbee league data between average per game plus/minus score and Self Rating (left panel), Captain Rating (middle panel), and Existing BUDA Rating (right panel).  The Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient is printed in each panel. Ratings based on individual self-assessment (Self Rating) show a negative correlation with actual in-game performance, although the p-value of 0.08 indicates as much as an 8\% chance that this correlation could be a result of random noise. The absence of a strong, positive correlation in this plot indicates that Self Rating is not a useful predictor of team performance
