\section{Introduction}

Almost 5 million people in the Unitied States participate in the sport of Ultimate Frisbee.  Of these, 1.3 million are core participants---meaning that they play at least 13 times each year.  This is comparable to the sports of lacrosse (0.9 million) and rugby (0.4 million) combined \cite{sfia_2016}. Moreover, USA Ultimate---the premier organization for ultimate frisbee in the United States---has seen a 60\% growth in youth participation over the past five years \cite{usau_2016}.  While this segment of the population is focused on highly competitive play, we expect it to serve as a positive indicator for future growth of the sport at all levels.

Ultimate is unique in its emphasis on fair play, which is codified directly in the rulebook as ``Spirit of the Game``.  From Section 1. Introduction, item B:

\begin{quote} Spirit of the Game. Ultimate relies upon a spirit of sportsmanship that places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play.
\end{quote}

This commitment to fair play helps to explain why many core participants play in recreational leagues in which teams are assembled randomly according to skill level such that every team has an equal chance at winning---in theory.  These leagues typically have 10 - 20 teams with 15 - 20 players on each team.  They run throughout the year, with colder climates using indoor facilities during winter.

Another manifestation of Ultimate's ``Spirit of the Game'' is the emphasis on individual assessment when determining skill level of the participants in a recreational league.  A robust measure of skill level is critical to creating balanced teams.  Historically, teams in recreational leagues have been created by ranking players according to their self-assessed skill level and then assigning them to teams according to a snake-like draft system in which the order reverses with each round.  The team that draft firsts in round 1 drafts last in round 2, then first in round 3, etc.

One of the goals of this paper is to investigate the performance of self-assessment ratings relative to what is expected for teams of equal skill level.  Our results showing the poor performance of self-assessment ratings have motivated us to undertake a second goal: explore alternative rating systems that make use of data on what teams players have played on previously. 

We make use of seven years of data from the Boston Ultimate Disc Alliance (BUDA) in order to achieve our goals. BUDA is a non-profit organization run by volunteers to give people in the Boston area the opportunity to play Ultimate. BUDA organizes nearly 100\% of the leagues in the greater Boston area. BUDA has collected data since 2001 on who has played on what team and how that team performed during the season.
